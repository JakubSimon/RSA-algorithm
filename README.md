# RSA Algorithm
> Project uses asymmetric cryptographic algorithm RSA in order to encrypt and decrypt a message. It is able to hunt maximum 768-bit long prime numbers out (232 digits) to generate public and private keys.

## General info
This program uses two tests in order to generate large prime numbers with a high level of probability. The first of them is a low level test that is based on dividing the tested number by all first prime numbers lower than 1000. The second one is Millerâ€“Rabin primality test which is a probabilistic primality test: an algorithm which determines whether a given number is likely to be prime. Next, using the RSA Algorithm and other supporting algorithms, this programs generates public and private keys in order to enccrypt and decrypt messages.

4) Encoding message:

* encode from text allows to encode a one line message written using ASCII glyphs

* encode from file allows to encode a multi line message written using ASCII glyphs and control characters saved in .txt extension

5) Decoding message:

* decode from text allows to paste a enrypted message and decpryt it

* decode from file allows to decode a encrypted message from .txt file

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development

Ready features:
* Generate 768-bit long prime numbers
